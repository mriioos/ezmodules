# Welcome to My Module Collection

Hello, user.

First of all, I want to apologize if my English is not perfect —it's not my primary language— but I'll do my best. I asked ChatGPT to correct this text.

This repository is a collection of modules created by me for my personal use. However, I've decided to share them because I believe it's a beneficial exercise for me. Additionally, I aim to contribute my knowledge to the community in case it proves useful to anyone else.

I want to assure you that I am not aware of any intentional errors or malfunctions in my code.

Please note that at the time of creating this repository, the uploaded modules are not functional; they were created for specific environments. Please refrain from attempting to use them, as they will not work out of the box. I've initiated this repository to create standalone versions of each module, and eventually, they will be fully functional.

Manu of this modules work almost as wrappers of the libraries they use, I will add some documentation file in every module called module_name.pdf with the extended functionality when the first version of each is released.

Thank you for taking the time to read this. Any advice, suggestions, or mentions are welcome. If you have feedback or would like to contribute, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Sincerely,

Miguel Ríos - April 5, 2024.
